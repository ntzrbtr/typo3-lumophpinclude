Explanation of processing options
=================================

The following processing options are available for all types of included scripts:

-     **Strip non-body parts** : Remove everything outside the body tag (including the tag itself)
      from the fetched script result
- **Strip content outside markers** : Strip everything outside the set markers from the fetched
  script result
- **Marker for stripping** : Marker for stripping; must be of the form <!-- MARKER -->
- **Wrap output into div** : have another div tag wrapped around the content to apply additional CSS
  directives on it. The class of the div tag is tx_lumophpinclude_<MD5 hash of included file name>

The following options are only available for remote scripts:

- **Rewrite internal links** : Change the URL of internal links (i.e. links whose URL does not have
  a host specified) to point to the same TYPO3 page; the new URL is the added as the URL parameter
  tx_lumophpinclude_url; this way, you can include a whole website.
- **Rewrite local resources (e.g. of images)** : Change the URL of all „src“ attriubutes in the
  fetched script result to point to the original server to have images displayed correctly though
  the HTML is displayed on your own page
