What does it do?
================

This extension lets you include complete external PHP solutions (e.g. message boards or image galleries) into TYPO3.
With this extension you are able to select a local PHP script as well as a call a script written in any language on a
remote server via a real HTTP request.

LumoNet PHP Include collects all data sent to the page where the plugin is used and transfers it to the called script
(this only applies to remote calls as local scripts are just included ans thus have access to all GET, POST and other
server data anyway). The user can choose to have GET data transferred to the called remote script (the transfer of POST
data, cookies and even the handling of file uploads will be realized in future versions).

LumoNet PHP Include also provides the ability to strip the resulting content of a called remote app so one can use the
PHP app stand-alone as well as integrated in a TYPO3 website.
